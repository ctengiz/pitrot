#Pitrot Project Management

Pitroit is a project management and issue tracking system. 

It is heavily inspired from [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org/), but it has also its own ways of doing things. 

Though, Pitrot may be considered in alpha stage and missing some features it is used in production environment internally since 2013.

Pitrot is written in Python3 and [SqlAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is used for DB access, 
so Pitrot should be cross platform and database agnostic.
